### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

Here I have attached some files to get staerted with the project for AutoComplete Search Suggestion using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Then save the files with name given and same extensions.
Run into your local server to see the demo.




Here I am getting an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'querySelectorAll' of null
at HTMLInputElement.InputBox.onkeyup (js.js:23)" when you see in console  by pressing F12 key.
Here I am attaching a screenshot.    
Your sugggetsions are always welcome!
Thankyou
